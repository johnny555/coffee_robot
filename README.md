# Coffee Robot 

Building a simple coffee delivery robot. 

# Mapping

Launch the mapping service, but don't forget to save the map when done. 

`rosrun map_server map_saver map:=/map`

Don't forget to measure the fiducials. We accidentally printed them 13.6cm accross, so all the settings need to be modified. 

# Networking

pifi is great. Add a network to the rpi
`pifi add <ssid> <passwd>`
